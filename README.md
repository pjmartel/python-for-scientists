# python-for-scientists

Files in this repo are the materials for the "Python for Scientists" introductory Python
course taught at the University of Algarve in June 3-4 2019.
They consist of Google Colab noteboks and some datasets to be used with them.

### Instructions

1. Use the links below to open a notebook in GitHub
2. At the document's top there will be an "Open in Colab" button
3. Make sure your browser is logged in on a Google Account
4. Press the button, and the notebook will open in the Colab environment
5. Use the option "Save a Copy in Drive" to sabe a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive
6. Read the introductory text at the beginning of the notebook
7. Activate the notebook by pressing the top-right connect buttuon or any cell play button
8. A warning will pop-up saying the notebook was not authored by Google, just proceed
9. Go through the notebook, from beginning to end.

(**NOTE:** After opening each notebook in the Colab environment, be sure to leave playground mode by saving a copy
of the notebook in your Google Drive, or you will risk losing all your changes when closing the browser.)
